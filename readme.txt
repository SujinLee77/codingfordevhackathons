Coding for Development and Social Change
========================================

Weekend-long introduction to web coding for international development peeps.  

Part of a set that includes:

* ICT for development and social change (the "don't be scared of the techies" course)

* DataScience for development and social change

Tools
=====

Things you will need:

* Ruby installed on your computer (free)
* Rails installed on your computer (free)
* A text editor, e.g. SublimeText http://www.sublimetext.com/

Things it would be very helpful for you to have: 

* An account on github.com (is free!)
* Git installed on your computer
* An account on heroku.com

Things you don’t need now but might want in the future:

* An IDE: http://viarails.net/q/Which-IDE-should-I-use-with-Ruby-on-Rails (Eclipse is good).  IDEs (Integrated Development Environments, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) are very powerful tools that help you edit and test your code.  They take a while to get used to, so we’re not overburdening you by adding them to this course.
